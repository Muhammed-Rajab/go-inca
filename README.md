> 🌟💡 Disclaimer: Please note that this project was built exclusively for educational purposes. I want to emphasize that while I have made efforts to ensure the quality of my code, I cannot guarantee its compatibility with your specific project. Therefore, I kindly request that you exercise caution when incorporating this code into your own work. My primary goal in undertaking this endeavor was to deepen my understanding of caching mechanisms while immersing myself in the enchanting world of golang, a language I have recently embraced. Let this project serve as a source of inspiration and knowledge, but remember to approach its utilization with prudence and care.
