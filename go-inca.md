Just implemented a doubly linkedlist and lru cache with basic functionality. Still hasn't found out the way to implement TTL.
This shit is fun af.

Everything thing is fast af, but I feel like I can improve it. Benchmarks are showing good results. I should do something to improve setting keys after capacity is over.

Just found out that I'm doing a lot of allocation,
which can worsen the performance. I think a better way to approach this issue is oncee you reach the capacity, then you should just reuse the allocated Node instead of just allocating new one.
