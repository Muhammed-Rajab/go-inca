I have no idea about what I'm getting into, but yeah.
I'mma try my best to learn as much as I can, no matter what :)

Just implemented a doubly linkedlist and lru cache with basic functionality. Still hasn't found out the way to implement TTL.
This shit is fun af.

Everything thing is fast af, but I feel like I can improve it. Benchmarks are showing good results. I should do something to improve setting keys after capacity is over.

Just found out that I'm doing a lot of allocation,
which can worsen the performance. I think a better way to approach this issue is oncee you reach the capacity, then you should just reuse the allocated Node instead of just allocating new one.

Caught the culprit which made my code slower.
It's the fucking `Pop()` method. It uses 'Tail()' method which is an `O(n)` method,
which made setting new values relatively slow. I'm such a dumb fuck.
I didn't notice it there. Now the better way to implement it is by
keeping track of the `TailNode` in LRUCache struct.

DIGGITY DONG! Just made that silly change and now my code is 3.53438442983 √ó 10^9 times faster, like fuck, that's nearly 3.5  √ó 10^9 times faster, wtf?!?
```

LOL, I messed up. I think i fucked up the whole dll by doing
some stupid shit. My brain is quite literally fried from coding for the past 10 hours. I need a break :) A quick guess tho. If my current code is working fine, then it's 1.96x faster than my previous working version(still, that's a lot of improvement even tho it's not in the magnitude of 9)

Haven't stopped coding yet, and just found out the list provided by go ain't gonna be that useful for my purpose

Implemented a TTL system. Also found many bugs in the Set method as I was in a hurry to create a TTL system. Learned that always be very careful when you are modifying a struct in-place and also be careful with accessing struct fields in if-else statements. Both of these things can land you in very bad situations
